  {
    "question": "Does the 737-800 have a critical engine? There is no critical engine on a jet engine, in strong crosswind",
    "answer": " the upwind engine may act as a critical engine, this is because there is hardly any p factor and the engines are symmetrical plus torque eÔ¨Äects on the airframe are not as apparent as in a propeller aircraft."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the CFM56-7B engine on the 737-800 work? The air races through the fan that acts like a",
    "answer": " huge propeller accelerating the air which is separated, so only 20% of the air goes into the engine and 80% of the air is bypassed creating huge thrust. (due to its enormous volume, the air only needs to be accelerate through the bypass duct in order to create thrust) This is the bypass ratio and is about 5:1, 20% of the air that enters the engine goes Ô¨Årst to the low-pressure compressor that compresses the air so the pressure and temperature rises, then it enters the high-pressure compressor that rotates faster causing the pressure and temperature (450 degrees Celsius) to rise even further. (this is in a convergent duct causing the velocity to rise, venturi eÔ¨Äect), It then enters a diÔ¨Äuser to lower its velocity, then the air is mixed with fuel and then ignited in the combustor (1700 degrees Celsius) increasing the energy level (more pressure = more energy when heated). The hot air then spins the high-pressure turbines that are connected via shaft to the high- pressure compressors, known as the high spool. Then the air passes through the larger low-pressure turbine that powers the low-pressure compressor, the last turbine powers the fan, Ô¨Ånally the combusted air races down through the exhaust nozzle at the back to be accelerated one more time producing 20% of thrust, the remaining 80% being created by accelerated bypass air. In basic English: A turbine fan is therefore a Ô¨Çow cycle engine, air is compressed then heated by burning fuel, after which it passes through the turbines which drive the compressors and the fan."
  },
  {
    "question": "DiÔ¨Äerences between the 737-800 and the MAX?",
    "answer": " ‚Ä¢ New CFM-LEAP-1B Engines which are bigger than the CFM56-7B engines (diameter is bigger by 8 inches), this gives a 9:1 bypass ratio versus 5:1, the maximum thrust is 29,300lbs versus the older engine‚Äôs 27,300lbs. ‚Ä¢ This version is quieter thanks to its new engines, it is also 12% more fuel eÔ¨Écient and 7% reduction in operating costs. ‚Ä¢ Fly-by-wire spoiler system ‚Äì improves stopping distances and reduces weights. ‚Ä¢ Reshaped tail cone ‚Äì reduces drag giving 1% less in fuel burn. ‚Ä¢ The cockpit of the 737 MAX is a lot more reÔ¨Åned and uncluttered, it has the latest avionics and four large 15-inch LCD screens. ‚Ä¢ New electronic bleed air system ‚Äì increased optimisation of the cabin pressure and ice protection systems, giving better fuel burn. (the electric controller allows the aircraft to tune in the amount of air that is needed rather than the all or nothing system. ‚Ä¢ The thrust line has changed because the engines had to be moved forward and up to accommodate the larger fan diameter. Any handling diÔ¨Äerences as a result of this have been tuned out by Boeing in the Ô¨Çight control system to make the types feel the same to Ô¨Çight crew. (necessary to keep certiÔ¨Åcation under the same type certiÔ¨Åcate) (nose gear strut lengthened by 8 inches to give more engine ground clearance) ‚Ä¢ The standard wingtips of the MAX are boomerang winglets (currently optional on the 737- 800), the lower split-scimitar winglet aerofoil generates a vertical lift component that is vectored away from the fuselage and also slightly forward increasing the eÔ¨Éciency of the wing. (reducing fuel costs) ‚Ä¢ Also, the 737 MAX has 197 seats compared to the 737-800 which only has 189, a new emergency exit S F√ÄFNIR -17083ohm was added, toilets moved back, galley spaces lowered and the seats are slimmer. MCASR ‚Üì AUTOMATIC TRIM THAT Waits to CLUE TO PILOTS THE FEELING OF Flying a 800"
  },
  {
    "question": "Electrical system of a 737-800?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What advantages/disadvantages are there with swept wings?",
    "answer": " The advantages are: High Mach cruise speed because the wing delays the airÔ¨Çow over the wing from going supersonic and allows the aircraft to maximize the jet engine‚Äôs potential for higher Mach cruise speed. Also a swept wing is designated with a minimal chamber and thickness, thereby reducing proÔ¨Åle drag, which further increases the wing‚Äôs ability for higher speeds. Stability in turbulence, because the swept wing‚Äôs produces less li8 and therefore is less responsive to up draughts. The disadvantages are: Poor lift qualities, because the design of the wing has the eÔ¨Äect of reducing the lift capabilities of the wing. Higher stall speed, consequence of the poor lift qualities. Speed instability, second consequence of poor lift qualities at lower speeds. Speed is unstable below minimum drag speed , where power is required with reducing speed. Wing-tip stalling, because of the high local CL. This could be solved by a greater chamber on the tip section, or with the twisting (washout) which creates a lower angle of incidence at the wing tip."

They can be used for roll control (spoilers are raised on one wing and not on the other, which creates an imbalance of li8 values that produce a rolling moment), as air speed brakes (they air raised symmetrically on both wings to a Ô¨Çight detent position which cause a large increase in drag that slows down the speed of the aircraft) and as ground li8 dumpers (they are raised symmetrically thus causing a large increase in drag decreasing li8 over the wing and causing the aircraft to sink on the ground)."

  {
    "question": "What is Dutch roll?",
    "answer": " Dutch roll is an oscillatory instability associated with swept-wing jet aircraft, a combination of yawing and rolling motions. It occurs when a yaw is induced either by a natural disturbance or by a commanded or an uncommanded yaw input on a swept wing aircraft. This cause the outer wing to run faster thus creating more li8 because of the increased angle of a[ack. At the same time, the inner wing will travel slower and become more swept relative to the airÔ¨Çow, reducing its li8. Therefore a marked bank occurs to the point where the outer upward moving wing exceeds its critical angle of a[ack, stalls and loses all li8. The wing will drop causing a yaw to the dropped wing and thus leading to the sequence being repeated in the opposite direction. ‚Ä¢ HIGH LATERAL STABILITY ‚Ä¢ LOW DIRECTION AL STABILITY"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a yaw damper?",
    "answer": " A yaw damper is a gyro system that is sensitive to changes in yaw, and it feeds a signal into the rudder, which applies opposite rudder to the yaw before the roll occurs thus preventing dutch roll.and eventually a roll. Dihedral wings Dihedral is the upward inclination of a wing from the root to the tip. The sideslip conditions produce greater angle of attack on the forward-yawed wing and smaller angle of a[ack on the rearward-yawed wing. As greater angle of attack produces more lift (in the usual case, when the wing is not near stalling), the forward wing will have more lift and the rearward wing will have less lift. This diÔ¨Äerence in lift between the wings is a rolling moment, and since it is caused by sideslip, it is dihedral eÔ¨Äect (or more correctly, it is a contribution to the total dihedral eÔ¨Äect of the aircraft)."

  },
  {
    "question": "How would you recover from Dutch roll without a yaw damper? The aircraft is more prone to Dutch roll",
    "answer": " at a higher altitude, as altitude (and therefore TAS) increases, the directional stability reduces at a greater rate than lateral stability, the correction would be to Ô¨Çy low and slow, the denser the air, the more damping there is, which means the yaw oscillations will die out quicker."

    "question": "How does a wing work and how is lift created?",
    "answer": " ‚Ä¢ An aerofoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it Ô¨Çows past. (newtons) ‚Ä¢ As the velocity changes around an object, the pressure changes as well, the pressure on the upper surface where the Ô¨Çow is moving faster is lower than the pressure on the lower surface where it is moving slower. ‚Ä¢ The airÔ¨Çow follows the curvature of the aerofoil (downwards), the upper surface is moving faster, so causes the aerofoil exerting a downward force generating lift. Lift is created due to air pressure diÔ¨Äerences between the lower and the upper surfaces of the wing, which are caused due to the curvature of the wing that generates a Venturi tube eÔ¨Äect (high pressure air below the wing moving towards low pressure air above the wing). The greater the curvature of the wing, the greater its lift capability. -Each aircraft is designed to stall at a speciÔ¨Åc angle of attack (for a given conÔ¨Åguration) and can stall at any airspeed, attitude or altitude if this critical angle of attack is exceeded -However, at high altitudes and high M, critical angle of attack reduces and stall speed increases. This is due to wing reaching its lift capability limits at high M -Also, in case of airframe icing, the critical angle of attack may be reduced STICK SHACKER MAY NOT > ACTIUATE DUE TO REDUCES -Wing conÔ¨Åguration has an impact on critical angle of attack as well. Extension of leading edge slats and Ô¨Çaps increases the critical angle of attack, whereas extension of trailing edge Ô¨Çaps reduces the critical angle of attack CRITICAL ‚úó THAT HAS ALREADY Beer EXEDEED"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is critical angle of attack reduced when extending trailing edge Ô¨Çaps?",
    "answer": " -A wing will stall when it reaches the critical angle of attack, which is the angle at which the wing has reached its maximum lift capability (Clmax) -When we extend trailing edge Ô¨Çaps, Clmax increases and, for a given angle of attack, Lift produced by the wings increases as well -However, the wings are not able to sustain this higher lift up to the same angle of attack that they can when the Ô¨Çaps are up -This means that although Clmax increases, it is achieved at a lower angle of attack (critical angle) than it is achieved with Ô¨Çaps up and therefore, critical angle of attack decreases"

  {
    "question": "How are thunderstorms formed?",
    "answer": " Thunderstorms are normally associated with cumulonimbus clouds. These clouds are formed with 4 conditions: -High moisture content in the air -A trigging lifting action to cause a parcel of air rising (convection, turbulence, frontal, orographic) -Adiabatic cooling of the air -High instability (once the air starts to rise it will continue rising), ELR must be greater than SALR During the development of the CB updrafts move air aloft, allowing condensation to take place throughout the ascent of the convective currents. During the mature stage, water drops start to fall through the cloud, but stronger upwards current will increase the cloud: updrafts (5-60008/min) in this stage are stronger than downdrafts (30008/min). This is the most hazardous phase of thunderstorms, where we can Ô¨Ånd hail, torrential rain, severe turbolence, severe icing, windshear, microbursts and lightning. Decaying stage is the Ô¨Ånal stage of the thunderstorm. In this phase there is an end of continuous rain and the start of sporadic showers. At higher levels it may take on the anvil shape as upper winds spread out under the tropopause. An anvil must be avoided because of the presence of strong downward vertical currents beneath it. A thunderstorm can produce several hazards for aircrafts: severe windshear, turbulence, icing, hail, reduced visibility, lightning strikes and radio comms and navs interference. CBs must be avoided by a minimum of 10NM and, in severe conditions, by at least 20NM. ‚Ä¢ > 2h FOR ALL STAGES ‚Ä¢ MOVING AT THE 10000ft WIND ‚Ä¢ LICHT/ I / C MORE LIKELY BETWEEN - 10¬∫ and -110¬∞C"

In a warm front, the frontal air at alEtude is actually well ahead of its depicted position on a weather chart. On the weather charts warm front is represented by half circles along the front line. As the warm front approaches: lowering of the cloud base. Clouds change from cirrus to cirrostratus to altostratus with possible change into nimbostratus with rainfall. Poor visibility, due to the increase in low-level clouds and rain. Atmospheric pressure fall. As the warm front passes: rise in temperature, due to the arrival of the warm sector air mass.

    "question": "What is a cold front?",
    "answer": " A cold front is a boundary between two air masses, where the colder, denser air mass undercuts and replaces the warmer preceding air mass from the surface upward. On weather charts cold front is represented by barbs along the front line. As the cold front approaches: cumulus and cumulonimbus is experienced, so we can Ô¨Ånd heavy rain, thunderstorm, turbulence and wind shear. Poor visibility due to the increase in heavy clouds through a large vertical band and heavy rain. The atmospheric pressure will fall. As the cold front passes: drop in air temperature, due to the arrival of the cold sector. Clear skies, good visibility, wind veers in direction in the northern hemisphere and backs in the southern hemisphere. Atmospheric pressure will stop falling and start rising.

There are several types of ice, but the most common are: clear ice, rime ice or hoar frost. Clear ice is a very serious form of icing, heavy and diÔ¨Écult to remove. It forms when supercooled droplets impact with an air frame. The water Ô¨Çow over the frame releasing latent heat before freezing. It‚Äôs normally found in CBs and nimbostratus, where you can Ô¨Ånd large droplets (moderate or severe). Rime ice is formed by smaller droplets which tends to freeze instantly. It is a granular coating which is normally easy to remove. Can occur in any cloud with small water droplets or freezing fog (light to moderate). Hoar frost occurs when air is cooled to the temperature at which saturation occurs and the airframe is below 0¬∞C. It is formed by sublimation: water vapour turns directly to ice without passing through the liquid state. It can occur on ground or a8er takeoÔ¨Ä. Problems related with ice are: - Adverse aerodynamic performance eÔ¨Äects reducing stalling angle and maximum li8 capability, and thus increasing stall speed and drag. - Control surfaces may be freezed. - Increase in aircraft weight. - Reduced engine power (jet intake or carburettor can restrict the air Ô¨Çow into the engine). - Vent blockage eÔ¨Äects (pitot and static ports). - Degraded navigation and radio communication eÔ¨Äects if ice builds up in aerials."

    "answer": " conditions are met: There must be a deep layer of unstable air, the air must be warm and moist, a trigger mechanism must cause the moist warm air to rise. (lifting action) (warm air rises because it expands, it becomes less dense than the air around it and hence air pressure exerts an upward force, warm air is less pressure, cold air is denser and more pressure) ‚Ä¢ Building phase ‚Äì Updrafts move the warm air aloft, allowing condensation (vapour to liquid) to take place throughout the ascent. (warm air rises, and cools... once it cools to its dewpoint, water droplets are produced), it continues to rise and starts getting bigger and bigger. (cumulus cloud) ‚Ä¢ Mature phase ‚Äì In the mature stage of a thunderstorm, the warmed air continues to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no further (tropopause), the air is instead forced to spread out giving an ‚Äòanvil‚Äô shape resulting in a CB, the water droplets form into large and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles, as these fall they melt to become rain. (if the updrafts are strong enough the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail), while updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it creating downdrafts as well, this is then the mature stage of the storm and creates CB‚Äôs. Downdrafts can reach 3000ft per minute, and updrafts can reach 5000ft per minute. The mature stage is the most hazardous stage, the dangers include: rain, hail, severe turbulence, severe icing, wind shear and microbursts and lightning. ‚Ä¢ Decaying phase ‚Äì In the decaying phase, the thunderstorm is dominated by a downdraft, if conditions don‚Äôt support cellular development this stage occurs rather quickly.

    "question": "What's an INS? What's the diÔ¨Äerences with a GPS?",
    "answer": " An INS is an onboard self-contained inertial navigation system that can provide continuous information on an aircraft‚Äôs position without any external assistance. An IRS is a modern INS that usually has a greater integration into the Ô¨Çight management system (FMS) and provides the aircraft‚Äôs actual magnetic position and heading information with reference to the FMS required position and heading. The general principle of all inertial navigation system (INS) is that the system measures the aircraft‚Äôs inertial movement from an initial position as a great circle track direction and distance to continuously determine its up-to-date position. The components of the IRS are ACCELEROMETERS, GYROSCOPES and POSITION COMPUTER. The aircraft moves in 3 dimensions but the navigation equipment is only interested in acceleration in the horizontal plane, therefore the key to the whole INS arrangement is the ACCELEROMETERS. An INS is a better system than the Global Positioning System for providing navigation mainly because the downgrading imposed on the normal GPS and because the IRS is the only truly onboard self-contained system, therefore is not prone to external inÔ¨Çuences (natural eÔ¨Äects or transmitter errors such as those which aÔ¨Äect the GPS).
