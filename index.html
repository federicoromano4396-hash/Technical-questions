(nitrogen oxide) ‚Ä¢ Winglets oÔ¨Äer better climb performance which also lowers thrust settings, thus extending engine life and reducing maintenance costs, on the take-oÔ¨Ä, winglets allow up to 3% incremental de-rate and also allow a steeper climb improving take-oÔ¨Ä/climb performance especially from obstacle limited, high, hot, weight limited and noise restricted airports, in the cruise thrust levels are reduced by up to 4%. ‚Ä¢Winglets increase the lift generated at the wingtip and reduce the lift induced drag caused by wingtip vortices. (recovery of the wingtip vortices)."}, {"question": "What is the fuel capacity of a 737-800?", "answer": "20,000 kgs, 26000 litres"}, {"question": "What is the range of a 737-800?", "answer": "3000nm, 8200: 3700nm"}, {"question": "What is the FMA?", "answer": "Where is it location? Explain the modes? ‚Ä¢ The FMA is a Ô¨Çight mode annunciator which indicates what system is controlling the aircraft and what mode is operational. 8000FT9.1PSIMAX ‚Ä¢ The FMA is located on the top of the captain and Ô¨Årst oÔ¨Écers PFD (primary Ô¨Çight display) ‚Ä¢ The FMA is divided into 3 columns and 2 rows, the left column relates to the A/T (auto- throttle), while the centre and right-hand column display roll and pitch modes. The upper row indicates modes are that operational (green), and the lower row indicates modes that are armed (white)."}, {"question": "Icing protection and systems on a 737-800?", "answer": "‚Ä¢ Windshield heat ‚Äì electrically heated, prevents ice building up, also oÔ¨Äers protection from bird strikes and hail as the windshield becomes pliable, whereas a cold window is brittle. (speed restriction of 250kts below 10,000ft) ‚Ä¢ Wing Anti-ice ‚Äì the wing anti-ice system provides protection for the three inboard leading- edge slats by using bleed air. ‚Ä¢ Engine Anti-Ice ‚Äì the engine anti-ice heats the engine cowl to prevent ice build-up, which could break oÔ¨Ä and enter the engine. The 737-800 have an elliptical cone shaped spinner which also prevents ice build-up and deÔ¨Çects ice away, the engine anti-icing uses bleed air, uses 5th and 9th stage compressor. ‚Ä¢ Ice detection ‚Äì an advisory only ice detection system detects airplane icing in Ô¨Çight. The system consists of a probe on the forward left fuselage, when the system detects ice build- up, the ICING light illuminates. ‚Ä¢ Probe and sensor heat ‚Äì Pitot probes, total air temperature probes and the alpha vanes are electrically heated, the static ports are not heated."}, {"question": "Can the 737-800 Ô¨Çy in icing conditions?", "answer": "The 737-800 can be dispatched into light and moderate conditions if the PIC and the dispatcher thinks it‚Äôs safe, but not into severe."}, {"question": "Emergency exits available to pilots?", "answer": "#2 window on each side, there is also an escape rope."}, {"question": "Max Mach number on a 737-800?", "answer": "Mach 0.82"}, {"question": "What is the cruise speed of a 737-800?", "answer": "MNO 0.78 ‚Äì 0.80"}, {"question": "What is VNE and what limits it?", "answer": "Never exceed speed, Transport category planes uses VMO and MMO, 737-800 VMO is 480-490 KIAS, it‚Äôs limited by structural limit."}, {"question": "Max ceiling of a 737-800?", "answer": "41,000ft Absolute ceiling."}, {"question": "MTOW of a 737-800?", "answer": "78000kg / 172,475 lbs"}, {"question": "How many exits on a 737-800?", "answer": "8 exits."}, {"question": "Which direction does the fan blades rotate on a 737-800?", "answer": "Both engines rotate clockwise."}, {"question": "What is the ratio?", "answer": "The ratio is how much air goes around the engine to how much goes into the core. &gt;ANDWI/DOWFOGCINGV‚Ä¢Li-112‚ó¶121-1122‚Ä¢NO13,R} ‚òÜe√†Fse B737 winglets?‚Ä¢ 737-200 Mini-Winglets.‚Ä¢ 737 Classic/NG Blended Winglets.‚Ä¢ 737 NG Split Scimitar Winglets.‚Ä¢ 737 MAX Advanced Technology Winglets.What is cost index?-It‚Äôs the ratio of the aircraft operating cost to fuel cost -You get the number from the Ô¨Çight plan and write it into the FMC-It give the speeds for climbs, cruise, descent and it gives optimum altitude -High cost index ‚Äî&gt; Ô¨Çy fast to stay less in air -B737NG ‚Äî&gt; 0 - 500 CIWhat is optimum altitude?-Altitude which results in the minimum total trip cost (time/fuel) ‚Äî&gt; does not depend on fuel burn only-Calculated by FMC, doesn‚Äôt count the wind -It increases during the Ô¨Çight as weight decreasesIt is deÔ¨Åned as being the pressure altitude which provides the greatest speciÔ¨Åc range or fuel mileage at a given weight and speed.‚úì√å,"}, {"question": "Does the 737-800 have a critical engine?", "answer": "There is no critical engine on a jet engine, in strong crosswind the upwind engine may act as a critical engine, this is because there is hardly any p factor and the engines are symmetrical plus torque eÔ¨Äects on the airframe are not as apparent as in a propeller aircraft."}, {"question": "How does the CFM56-7B engine on the 737-800 work?", "answer": "The air races through the fan that acts like a huge propeller accelerating the air which is separated, so only 20% of the air goes into the engine and 80% of the air is bypassed creating huge thrust. (due to its enormous volume, the air only needs to be accelerate through the bypass duct in order to create thrust) This is the bypass ratio and is about 5:1, 20% of the air that enters the engine goes Ô¨Årst to the low-pressure compressor that compresses the air so the pressure and temperature rises, then it enters the high-pressure compressor that rotates faster causing the pressure and temperature (450 degrees Celsius) to rise even further. (this is in a convergent duct causing the velocity to rise, venturi eÔ¨Äect), It then enters a diÔ¨Äuser to lower its velocity, then the air is mixed with fuel and then ignited in the combustor (1700 degrees Celsius) increasing the energy level (more pressure = more energy when heated). The hot air then spins the high-pressure turbines that are connected via shaft to the high-pressure compressors, known as the high spool. Then the air passes through the larger low-pressure turbine that powers the low-pressure compressor, the last turbine powers the fan, Ô¨Ånally the combusted air races down through the exhaust nozzle at the back to be accelerated one more time producing 20% of thrust, the remaining 80% being created by accelerated bypass air. In basic English: A turbine fan is therefore a Ô¨Çow cycle engine, air is compressed then heated by burning fuel, after which it passes through the turbines which drive the compressors and the fan."}, {"question": "DiÔ¨Äerences between the 737-800 and the MAX?", "answer": "‚Ä¢ New CFM-LEAP-1B Engines which are bigger than the CFM56-7B engines (diameter is bigger by 8 inches), this gives a 9:1 bypass ratio versus 5:1, the maximum thrust is 29,300lbs versus the older engine‚Äôs 27,300lbs. ‚Ä¢ This version is quieter thanks to its new engines, it is also 12% more fuel eÔ¨Écient and 7% reduction in operating costs. ‚Ä¢ Fly-by-wire spoiler system ‚Äì improves stopping distances and reduces weights. ‚Ä¢ Reshaped tail cone ‚Äì reduces drag giving 1% less in fuel burn. ‚Ä¢ The cockpit of the 737 MAX is a lot more reÔ¨Åned and uncluttered, it has the latest avionics and four large 15-inch LCD screens. ‚Ä¢ New electronic bleed air system ‚Äì increased optimisation of the cabin pressure and ice protection systems, giving better fuel burn. (the electric controller allows the aircraft to tune in the amount of air that is needed rather than the all or nothing system. ‚Ä¢ The thrust line has changed because the engines had to be moved forward and up to accommodate the larger fan diameter. Any handling diÔ¨Äerences as a result of this have been tuned out by Boeing in the Ô¨Çight control system to make the types feel the same to Ô¨Çight crew. (necessary to keep certiÔ¨Åcation under the same type certiÔ¨Åcate) (nose gear strut lengthened by 8 inches to give more engine ground clearance) ‚Ä¢ The standard wingtips of the MAX are boomerang winglets (currently optional on the 737- 800), the lower split-scimitar winglet aerofoil generates a vertical lift component that is vectored away from the fuselage and also slightly forward increasing the eÔ¨Éciency of the wing. (reducing fuel costs) ‚Ä¢Also, the 737 MAX has 197 seats compared to the 737-800 which only has 189, a new emergency exit was added, toilets moved back, galley spaces lowered and the seats are slimmer."}, {"question": "Electrical system of a 737-800?", "answer": "‚Ä¢ Primary electrical power is provided by two engine integrated drive generators (IDGS) which are rated at 90 KVA (kilo-volt amps) and supply three-phase, 115-volt, 400 cycle (Hz) alternating current. ‚Ä¢ The battery is a 36 ampere-hour, 24-volt, nickel-cadmium battery and should provide around 30 minutes standby power if all other generators fail. ‚Ä¢ Auxiliary Battery ‚Äì This is a reserve battery on the 737NG which is normally isolated unless the main battery is powering the standby system, the auxiliary battery combined with the main battery can provide 60 minutes of standby power.

When the aircraft has stopped, select Ô¨Çaps to 40 degrees, select ‚ÄúMAN‚Äù on the pressurisation panel and open the outÔ¨Çow valve."}, {"question": "Hydraulic pressure for 737-800?", "answer": "‚Ä¢ Normal hydraulic pressure is 3000 psi ‚Ä¢ Minimum hydraulic pressure is 2800 psi ‚Ä¢ Maximum hydraulic pressure is 3500 psi ‚Ä¢ Normal brake accumulator pre-charge is 1000psi"}, {"question": "How are control surfaces operated on a 737-800?", "answer": "Primary Ô¨Çight controls linked mechanically to hydraulic power control units which command the primary Ô¨Çight control surfaces: ailerons, elevators and rudder, the Ô¨Çight controls are powered by system A and system B."}, {"question": "How many hydraulic systems does the 737-800 have?", "answer": "What do they operate? Either A or B hydraulic system can power all Ô¨Çight controls with no decrease in airplane controllability. Both A and B hydraulic systems have an engine-driven pump and an AC electric motor-driven pump. (The system A engine-driven pump is powered by No.1 engine, and the system B engine-driven pump is powered by No.2 engine.)

A supercharger increases the air delivered to the engine cylinder above its normal aspirated capacity by compressing the intake air, which in turn requires more fuel to be delivered to the carburettor to maintain the correct mixture ratio, which in turn produces a greater power output. The diÔ¨Äerence between turbo and supercharger is that superchargers are not powered by exhaust gases but are connected directly or indirectly to an engine. A superchargers uses mechanical energy from the engine to drive the supercharger.

(thermal gradients)"}, {"question": "Where is a Jetstream found and how high?", "answer": "‚Ä¢ Subtropical Jetstream ‚Äì (west-east) Usually found around 30 degrees of latitude, normally found between 33,000ft to 52,000ft. ‚Ä¢ Polar front Jetstream ‚Äì (west-east) Usually found around 60 degrees of latitude, normally found between 30,000ft to 39,000ft. (this is the strongest, especially when it is over land in the winter) ‚Ä¢Usually Jetstream‚Äôs are 1500nm long, 200nm wide, and 12000ft deep."}, {"question": "How strong does the wind have to be to be considered a jet stream?", "answer": "To be classiÔ¨Åed as a jet stream, the minimum is 60kts. Why westerly? Jetstream‚Äôs are westerly due to the Coriolis eÔ¨Äect (caused by the earths rotation, deÔ¨Çects wind to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern hemisphere)"}, {"question": "What is clear air turbulence?", "answer": "Clear air turbulence is deÔ¨Åned as sudden severe turbulence occurring in cloudless regions that causes violent buÔ¨Äeting of the aircraft. Any CAT is strongest on the cold side of the jet stream where the wind shear is greatest, CAT can be encountered 7000ft below to about 3000ft above the tropopause."}];
